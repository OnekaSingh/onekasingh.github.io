  <h3> Building a Quantum Computer with Optical Tweezers and NV-Diamonds </h3>
  <p> Foreword: <br> <br>
	I am leading a self-motivated quantum research project with a group of dedicated peers. As this is the first of its kind at West Valley College, our project work faces unique challenges due to limited access to the specialized resources and adequate funding often required for NV Diamond experiments.
        Thus, we independently secure funding and coordinate with various departments to meet our needs. In this strategic light, our project seeks to maximize efficiency in the ratio of resources to quality. My previous knowledge on the matter has come from my classes, previous independent research, and particularly Mark Fox's textbook on Quantum Optics: An Introduction.
<br> <br> Abstract: <br> <br>
Our experiment introduces a model for a basic NV Diamond quantum computer currently targeting 1 and 2 qubit gates. Our ultimate targate is creating an NV Diamond ensemble, and experimentally deducing the upper limit of our structure's qubit scalability.
Our design utilizes optical tweezers setup to capture a nano NV-Diamond. Using a trap and an initialization laser, in the
presence of a static magnetic field, the lone-electron-pair generated in the NV-vacancy forms a spin triplet--the basis of our qubit.
Quantum gates are implemented by manipulating this triplet state with microwave pulses, where the pulse duration dictates the
gate operation; we read the state of our system through emitted fluorescence through ODMR. This system follows the Jaynes-Cummings
model, and the computations performed can be visually represented on the Bloch Sphere.
This research project encompasses a variety of our curiosity-motivated questions: What types of single and multi-qubit gates
can be implemented on our setup, and what tangible algorithms can we build? How can we optimize hardware for reliable and
accurate performance? What conditions enhance quantum coherence while minimizing resource usage? What observable
quantum phenomena arise, and are there discernible patterns in these behaviors?
With these inquiries, we outline our experimental framework, conduct the experiment, document our observations, and report
on our findings and reflections in our publication.

  <h3> Quantum Complexity and a Deep Analysis of the HHL Algorithm </h3>
  <p> Foreword: <br> <br>
	This research was conducted as part of the BeyondPhysics Quantum Research Program, where over 30 teams
	explored diverse topics in quantum computing. My partner and I focused on quantum computational complexity, collaborating
	closely under the guidance of experienced mentor Andreea Lefterovici. Together, we developed a research paper and poster, which we presented
	within our group. Our work was recognized for its quality and nominated for presentation to all program participants, ultimately
	earning us 2nd place in the program.
	<br> <br> Abstract: <br> <br>
	We present the classical and quantum complexity of linear system problems (LSP), comparing the asymptotic performance
	of the classical Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) and the quantum Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm using Big-O notation.
	We then lightly explain HHL’s sub-components, with the primary objective of highlighting the quantum algorithm’s response to
	solving the LSP task, and its corresponding scalability (input size to time). <br>
	 With an overview of computational complexity classes, we classify CGM and HHL accordingly, and ponder open questions
	in complexity theory, such as the relationship between P and NP, as well as the position of BQP within PSPACE. We then compare
	CGM--the fastest classical algorithm for LSP--to the quantum LSP solver, HHL, emphasizing the distinction between their classical
	and quantum approaches. <br>
	 Next, we dissect HHL into its core sub-algorithms, including the Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT), Quantum Phase
	Estimation (QPE) and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). This section delves into the mathematical principles underpinning each
	quantum gate, showing the way quantum algorithms like HHL can achieve superior time complexity for higher input sizes.
	 Validating our proof of concept, we implement CGM in Python and analyze its performance across varying input sizes,
	referencing Big-O expectations. We then simulate HHL on some of IBM’s Qiskit backends, taking into account input limitations.
	Conclusively, we discuss current quantum computing architecture limitations that hinder the practicality of quantum algorithms
	(HHL is better suited to fault-tolerant quantum computers due to hardware restrictions and decoherence). </p>
