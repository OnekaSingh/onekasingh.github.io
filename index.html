  <h3> Quantum Complexity and a Deep Analysis of the HHL Algorithm </h3>
  <h4> Foreword: <br>
	This research was conducted as part of the BeyondPhysics Quantum Research Program, where over 30 teams
	explored diverse topics in quantum computing. My partner and I focused on quantum computational complexity, collaborating
	closely under the guidance of experienced mentor Andreea Lefterovici. Together, we developed a research paper and poster, which we presented
	within our group. Our work was recognized for its quality and nominated for presentation to all program participants, ultimately
	earning us 2nd place in the program.
	<br> Abstract: <br>
	We present the classical and quantum complexity of linear system problems (LSP), comparing the asymptotic performance
	of the classical Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) and the quantum Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm using Big-O notation.
	We then lightly explain HHL’s sub-components, with the primary objective of highlighting the quantum algorithm’s response to
	solving the LSP task, and its corresponding scalability (input size to time). <br>
	 With an overview of computational complexity classes, we classify CGM and HHL accordingly, and pondering open questions
	in complexity theory, such as the relationship between P and NP, as well as the position of BQP within PSPACE. We then compare
	CGM--the fastest classical algorithm for LSP--to the quantum LSP solver, HHL, emphasizing the distinction between their classical
	and quantum approaches. <br>
	 Next, we dissect HHL into its core sub-algorithms, including the Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT), Quantum Phase
	Estimation (QPE), and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). This section delves into the mathematical principles underpinning each
	quantum gate, showing the way quantum algorithms like HHL can achieve superior time complexity for higher input sizes.
	 Validating our proof of concept, we implement CGM in Python and analyzed its performance across varying input sizes,
	referencing Big-O expectations. We then simulate HHL on some of IBM’s Qiskit backends taking in to account input limitations.
	Conclusively, we discuss current quantum computing architecture limitations which hinders the practicality of quantum algorithms
	(HHL is better suited on fault-tolerant quantum computers due to hardware restrictions and decoherence). </h4>
